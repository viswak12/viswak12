##  About Me

Welcome to my GitHub, where:

Machine learning models quietly run the show 

Python scripts automate everything but lunch ☕

SQL flows like poetry (with the occasional JOIN tantrum) 

Dashboards whisper secrets to executives (and sometimes scream at them) 

🎓 **M.S. in Computer Science** (Data Science focus) – University of North Texas – GPA: 3.81  
💼 **Data Scientist / Analyst Hybrid** with 4.5+ years of experience in **fraud analytics, product intelligence, healthcare, edtech, and fintech**  
📈 I specialize in **ML modeling, experiment design, stakeholder storytelling**, and making KPIs behave

By day: wrangle data, build models, create stories from noise  
By night: dream in `pandas`, `dbt`, and `JOIN` clauses

## 🚀 Projects That Turned Heads

### 🔍 **Fraud Detection in Health Claims**
Trained ML models on 2M+ claims data using Scikit-learn + Snowflake. Delivered 15% boost in fraud detection. Automated pipelines. Saved real money.

### 🎓 **ScholarEase**
End-to-end scholarship data platform. Eligibility logic, dbt transformations, dashboards, and a PeopleSoft bridge that actually worked. Academic admin-approved.

### 🎬 **Movie Recommender System**
Collaborative filtering + Random Forest = scarily accurate film suggestions. Possibly better than your Netflix algorithm.

### 📈 **User Growth Forecasting**
Forecasted growth + revenue trends using regression models. Delivered a 12% predictive uplift. Stakeholders started requesting “Viswak dashboards.”

### 📦 **Inventory Optimization**
Clustered inventory movement data using K-Means, paired with regression forecasting. Hit 98% accuracy — big win for ops.

### 🏥 **InsureSys Pro**
Insurance claim management app with Django, SQL, and Power BI dashboards. Built to be fast, auditable, and slick.

> I write models that explain. Queries that reveal. Dashboards that make execs say, “Wait… can we pin that?”
