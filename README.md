## 🧠 About Me

Welcome to my GitHub, where:
- SQL flows like poetry 🧾  
- Python scripts run before coffee ☕  
- Dashboards whisper secrets to executives 🧠  

🎓 **Master’s in Computer Science** (Data Science focus) from University of North Texas — GPA 3.81 (yes, I triple-checked)  
💼 **Senior Data Analyst** with 4.5+ years of experience across **healthcare, insurance, product analytics, and finance**  

By day, I tame messy data and build clean, useful things.  
By night, I occasionally dream in `pandas`, `SQL`, and `dbt` models.

## 🚀 Projects That Turned Heads

### 🔍 **Fraud Detection in Health Claims**
Built ML models on 2M+ claims to detect fraud in real-time. Result: 15% boost in detection accuracy and fewer headaches for investigators.

### 🎬 **IMDb Rating & Recommendation System**
Predicted movie ratings using Random Forest and K-Means. Recommender that might know you better than Netflix.

### 💸 **Crypto Trend Insights**
Visualized years of market madness using D3.js, Tableau, and Python. Traders still say thanks.

### 🎓 **ScholarEase**
A scholarship management system that made admins cry tears of joy. Smart workflows, eligibility logic, real-time reporting.

### 📈 **User Growth & Revenue Forecasting**
Built A/B frameworks and modeling pipelines that led to a 12% revenue bump. Coffee may have been involved.

### 📦 **Inventory Optimization**
Regression + clustering = 98% accuracy and a lot of saved money. Spreadsheets were proud.

### 🏥 **InsureSys Pro**
End-to-end insurance claim system built with Django, SQL, and Power BI. Automated, auditable, and kind of beautiful.
