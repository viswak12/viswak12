Hi, I'm Viswak Sena P (aka Data's Favorite Child™)

Welcome to my corner of GitHub where SQL flows like poetry, Python scripts run before coffee, and dashboards tell stories louder than charts should.

🎓 Recently minted with a Master’s in Computer Science (Data Science focus) from the University of North Texas. GPA? 3.81 — yes, I checked twice.

📊 By day, I’m a Senior Data Analyst with 4.5+ years of hands-on experience decoding messy datasets into real-world insights across healthcare, insurance, product, and finance. By night, I sometimes dream in pandas and dbt models.

🔍 I build:

🔐 Real-time fraud detection systems (think: finding the sneaky ones in 2M+ insurance claims)

📈 Behavioral analytics to decode user decisions (A/B tested and stakeholder approved)

📦 ETL pipelines and data models that actually work (Snowflake, SQL, Python, dbt)

🎨 Dashboards that whisper insights to execs (Power BI, Tableau, Looker)

💡 I believe data isn’t just numbers — it’s a story waiting to be translated, cleaned, transformed, and visualized… with just the right amount of weird.

🔧 My Toolkit

Languages: Python, SQL, R, T-SQLData Viz: Power BI, Tableau, Matplotlib, SeabornML/AI: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoostBig Data: Snowflake, Spark, Hive, AirflowCloud/DevOps: AWS, Azure, Docker, GitHub, dbt, JenkinsOther tools I argue with occasionally: Excel, Looker, JIRA, Figma, D3.js
